This is an electron boilerplate with the following technologies baked in:

- Electron

- Gulp
- @srakowski 's ElectronLikeVS template


## Setup

To get started, clone down the repo and run `npm install` in both the *root* directory and the *app* directory.


## Building

Build the entire project with `npm run build`.

Build just sass with `npm run sass` or `npm run scss` for whichever file format you prefer.


## Running

Run the built app with `npm start`.
